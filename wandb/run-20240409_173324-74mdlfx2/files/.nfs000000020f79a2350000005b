Question.
Low insulin to glucagon ratio is not seen in:
(A) Glycogen synthesis
(B) Glycogen breakdown
(C) Gluconeogenesis
(D) Ketogenesis
Answer.
(D) Ketogenesis
Explanation:
A low insulin to glucagon ratio is typically seen in states of ketosis, where the body is relying on ketones for energy instead of glucose. Therefore, option (D) Ketogenesis is the correct answer.
Glycogen synthesis (A) and glycogen breakdown (B) are processes that occur in the liver and are regulated by insulin and glucagon, respectively. Gluconeogenesis (C) is the process by which the liver and kidneys produce glucose from non-carbohydrate sources, such as amino ac
